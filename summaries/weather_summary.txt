Weather is a dynamic natural force shaped by temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, and air masses. It can rapidly change from sunny to stormy. Regions experience unique weather patterns: tropical areas are hot and rainy, polar regions are cold and icy, while temperate zones have four distinct seasons—spring with blossoms, summer with sunshine, autumn with falling leaves, and winter with snow. Weather impacts agriculture, transportation, and mood, and modern technology like satellites enhances its prediction accuracy. Understanding weather helps us plan and adapt, highlighting nature's power and beauty beyond mere conditions.
